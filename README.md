# Password-manager

1. Built a simple password manager using Python and the cryptography.fernet module for securev
encryption.
2. Automatically generates and stores a symmetric encryption key (key.key) if it doesnâ€™t exist.
3. Stores credentials in a local file (passwords.txt) with encrypted passwords and plain account
names.
4. Implemented functionality to add new credentials and view decrypted passwords from the file.
5. Used Fernet for symmetric key encryption, and os module for secure file handling.
6. Focused on data privacy without using a master password for ease of access during learning.
